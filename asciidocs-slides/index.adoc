== What is reactive Programming?

Reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of changes.

Reacting to single occurring events can also be seen as reactive programming.

== Reacting to single occurring events

=== Synchronous vs async/wait vs Reactive

[white,source, Dart]
----
void sayHelloSync(String name) {
  String hello = "Hello $name!";
  print(hello);
}

Future sayHelloAsync(String name) async {
  Future futureHello = Future(() => "Hello $name!");
  print(await futureHello);

}

void sayHelloReactive(String name) {
  Future futureHello = Future(() => "Hello $name!");
  futureHello.then((value) => print(value));
}

=== pros and cons
pros: +
can be executed parallel +
non-blocking +
declarative +
better code style

cons: +
sometimes tricky to use +
no immediate result +

=== Example

== Reactive streams




=== Example

== Reactive System

A Reactive System is defined by the Reactive Manifesto,
which is signed by almost 30,000 people.

==== Reactive system are:

* Responsive (antwortend)
* Resilient (unverw√ºstlich)
* Elastic (elastisch)
* Message Driven (Nachrichten gesteuert)

NOTE: A reactive system doesn't have to use reactive programming.

== Reactive Database Access and REST Requests

==== Similar benefits:
non-blocking +
low overhead +
can be used for scaling vertically +


=== Reactive Quarkus
Quarkus is build reactive and uses Eclipse Vert.x.
But, to fully benefit from this model, the application code should be written in a non-blocking manner.

=== Non-Reactive-Request
Non-reactive requests are executed on a worker-thread. Every request is processed by its own thread.

=== Reactive-Request
Reactive requests are executed on the IO-thread having higher concurrency and performance.

=== Is Reactive Quarkus worth using for your Project?

Probably not. +

==== Drawbacks:
harder to code +
you only benefit if you get multiple simultaneous requests +
if your code is blocking due to a coding mistake the performance is even worse

NOTE: For detailed information about a worker and IO threads in Quarkus visit https://quarkus.io/blog/io-thread-benchmark/

== Questions
Each of the following code samples has an error or is bad written. +
Can you find it?

=== Example 1
[white,source, Dart]
----
Future<int> calculateLongTask(){
longTask().then((value) => return value);
}
----

=== Example 2
[white,source, Dart]
----
Future<int> calculateLongTask() async{
  return await longTask().then((value) => value + 3);
}
----

=== Example 3
[white,source, Dart]
----
Future calculateLongTask(){
  longTask().then((value) => print(someMoreCalculations(value)));
}
