== What is reactive Programming?

Reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of changes.

Similar to the observer pattern.

Reacting to single occurring events can also be seen as reactive programming.

== Reacting to single occurring events

=== Real life Example: heating food in the microwave

* Async:
** put food in the microwave
** wait in front of the microwave until it finishes
** take out the food

* Reactive:
** put food in the microwave
** do something else
** when the microwave rings, take out the food

=== Synchronous vs async/wait vs Reactive

[source, Dart]
----
void sayHelloSync(String name) {
  String hello = "Hello $name!";
  print(hello);
}

Future sayHelloAsync(String name) async {
  Future futureHello = Future(() => "Hello $name!");
  print(await futureHello);
}

void sayHelloReactive(String name) {
  Future futureHello = Future(() => "Hello $name!");
  futureHello.then((value) => print(value));
}

=== Example


=== pros and cons
pros:

* can be executed parallel
* non-blocking
* declarative
* better code style

cons:

* sometimes tricky to use
* no immediate result

== Reactive streams

=== Real life Example: Restaurant
* every time the cook finishes a meal he shouts
* the waiter listens for shouts
* if he hears the cook shouting, he delivers the food

=== Use cases

* Server sent events
* Loading data
* Updating UI elements on data change
* ...

In most programming languages you can use functions like map, first where, ... on reactive streams

=== Example

== Reactive System

A Reactive System is defined by the Reactive Manifesto,
which is signed by almost 30,000 people.

Reactive system are:

* Responsive (antwortend)
* Resilient (unverw√ºstlich)
* Elastic (elastisch)
* Message Driven (Nachrichten gesteuert)

NOTE: A reactive system doesn't have to use reactive programming.

== Reactive Database Access and REST Requests

Similar benefits:

* non-blocking
* low overhead
* can be used for scaling vertically


=== Reactive Quarkus
Quarkus is build reactive and uses Eclipse Vert.x.
But, to fully benefit from this model, the application code should be written in a non-blocking manner.

=== Non-Reactive-Request
Non-reactive requests are executed on a worker-thread. Every request is processed by its own thread.

=== Reactive-Request
Reactive requests are executed on the IO-thread having higher concurrency and performance.

=== Is Reactive Quarkus worth using for your Project?

Probably not. +

Drawbacks:

* harder to code
* you only benefit if you get multiple simultaneous requests
* if your code is blocking due to a coding mistake the performance is even worse

NOTE: For detailed information about a worker and IO threads in Quarkus visit https://quarkus.io/blog/io-thread-benchmark/

== Questions
Each of the following code samples has an error or is bad written. +
Can you find it?

=== Example 1
[source, Dart]
----
Future<int> calculateLongTask(){
longTask().then((value) => return value);
}
----

=== Example 2
[source, Dart]
----
Future<int> calculateLongTask() async{
  return await longTask().then((value) => value + 3);
}
----

=== Example 3
[source, Dart]
----
Future calculateLongTask(){
  longTask().then((value) => print(someMoreCalculations(value)));
}
----
